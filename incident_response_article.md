# Digital Forensics and Incident Response: A SOC Analyst's Practical Guide

*Streamlining DFIR processes for faster containment and comprehensive threat analysis*

## Introduction

When an incident escalates beyond initial triage, SOC analysts must seamlessly transition from detection to deep forensic investigation. In my experience leading incident response efforts, the first few hours are critical—not just for containment, but for evidence preservation and threat attribution that can prevent future attacks.

This article outlines the systematic DFIR methodology I've developed through handling hundreds of security incidents, from ransomware outbreaks to advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns. The focus is on practical, repeatable processes that balance speed with forensic integrity.

## The SOC Analyst's DFIR Framework

### Phase 1: Rapid Triage and Evidence Preservation

**The Golden Hour Principle:**
The first 60 minutes of an incident determine the quality of your entire investigation. During this critical window, I follow a strict evidence preservation protocol:

```bash
# Immediate Memory Capture
# Priority: Capture volatile data before it's lost
./winpmem_v3.3.rc3.exe -o memory.raw
./volatility3 -f memory.raw windows.info

# Network Connection Analysis
netstat -ano > network_connections.txt
arp -a > arp_table.txt

# Process Analysis
tasklist /v > running_processes.txt
wmic process get processid,parentprocessid,commandline > process_details.txt

# Timeline Creation
fls -r -m C: image.dd > filesystem_timeline.txt
```

**Evidence Integrity Checklist:**
- [ ] Memory dump completed before system reboot
- [ ] Disk images created with write-blocking hardware
- [ ] Hash values documented for all evidence
- [ ] Chain of custody form initiated
- [ ] Network isolation implemented without destroying evidence

### Phase 2: Memory Forensics and Malware Analysis

**Volatility Analysis Workflow:**

Memory analysis often reveals the clearest picture of attacker activities. My standard Volatility workflow includes:

```python
# Process Analysis
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 pslist
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 pstree
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 malfind

# Network Artifacts
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 netscan
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 connscan

# Malware Detection
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 yarascan -y malware_rules.yar

# Registry Analysis
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 hivelist
vol.py -f memory.raw --profile=Win10x64 printkey -K "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
```

**Memory Forensics Red Flags:**

Through analyzing compromise scenarios, I've identified key memory artifacts that consistently indicate malicious activity:

- **Injected Processes:** Legitimate processes with suspicious memory regions
- **Hollow Processes:** Process names that don't match loaded modules
- **Network Connections:** Unexpected external communications
- **Privilege Escalation:** Processes running with elevated privileges unexpectedly

### Phase 3: Disk Forensics and Timeline Analysis

**Filesystem Timeline Construction:**

Creating a comprehensive timeline is crucial for understanding attack progression:

```bash
# Super Timeline Creation with log2timeline
log2timeline.py --storage-file timeline.plaso image.dd

# Timeline Analysis with psort
psort.py -w timeline.csv timeline.plaso

# Focused Analysis
psort.py -w filtered_timeline.csv timeline.plaso "date > '2024-01-15 00:00:00' AND date < '2024-01-16 00:00:00'"
```

**Key Filesystem Artifacts:**

Based on my incident investigations, these artifacts provide the most valuable insights:

**Windows Event Logs:**
```
- Security.evtx (Event ID 4624, 4625, 4648, 4768)
- System.evtx (Event ID 7045 for service installations)
- Application.evtx (Application crashes and errors)
- PowerShell/Operational (Event ID 4103, 4104)
```

**Registry Forensics:**
```
- HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
- HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
- HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
```

**Browser Forensics:**
```
- Chrome: History, Downloads, Cookies databases
- Firefox: places.sqlite, downloads.sqlite
- Edge: WebCacheV01.dat, History files
```

## Network Forensics and Traffic Analysis

### Packet Capture Analysis

When network captures are available, I focus on these key indicators:

**Protocol Distribution Analysis:**
```bash
# Wireshark/tshark analysis
tshark -r capture.pcap -q -z conv,ip
tshark -r capture.pcap -q -z prot,colinfo

# DNS Analysis
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "dns" -T fields -e dns.qry.name | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# HTTP Analysis
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri
```

**Lateral Movement Detection:**

Network analysis often reveals lateral movement patterns:

- **SMB Traffic:** Unusual file shares or authentication attempts
- **RDP Connections:** Unexpected remote desktop sessions
- **WMI Activity:** Remote Windows Management Instrumentation usage
- **PowerShell Remoting:** PSRemoting session establishment

### Advanced Network Analysis Techniques

**Beacon Detection:**

I've developed algorithms to identify C2 beacon traffic:

```python
def detect_beacons(network_data):
    """
    Identify potential C2 beacons through timing analysis
    """
    connections = parse_network_connections(network_data)
    
    for dest_ip in connections:
        intervals = calculate_time_intervals(connections[dest_ip])
        
        # Statistical analysis for regular intervals
        if is_regular_pattern(intervals):
            beacon_score = calculate_beacon_probability(intervals)
            
            if beacon_score > 0.8:
                flag_potential_beacon(dest_ip, beacon_score)
```

## Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

### Static Analysis Workflow

For malware samples discovered during incidents:

```bash
# File Information
file suspicious_binary.exe
strings suspicious_binary.exe | grep -i "http\|ip\|domain"

# Hash Analysis
md5sum suspicious_binary.exe
sha256sum suspicious_binary.exe

# Signature Detection
clamscan suspicious_binary.exe
yara -r malware_rules/ suspicious_binary.exe

# PE Analysis (Windows)
pefile suspicious_binary.exe
objdump -p suspicious_binary.exe
```

### Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox

**Controlled Execution Environment:**

I utilize isolated sandbox environments for safe malware execution:

- **Cuckoo Sandbox:** Automated behavioral analysis
- **VMware Snapshots:** Revertible analysis environment  
- **Network Simulation:** Controlled internet connectivity
- **API Monitoring:** System call tracing and analysis

**Key Behavioral Indicators:**
```
- File system modifications
- Registry key changes
- Network communication attempts
- Process injection techniques
- Persistence mechanism establishment
```

## Threat Attribution and Intelligence Integration

### Attack Vector Mapping

Using the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, I map incidents across four core features:

**Adversary → Infrastructure → Capability → Victim**

This methodology helps identify campaign patterns and predict future attacks.

### TTP Attribution Framework

**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:**

For each incident, I document observed TTPs:

```yaml
Initial Access:
  - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment
  - T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application

Execution:
  - T1059.001: PowerShell
  - T1059.003: Windows Command Shell

Persistence:
  - T1547.001: Registry Run Keys
  - T1053.005: Scheduled Task

Privilege Escalation:
  - T1055: Process Injection
  - T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
```

This mapping enables pattern recognition across multiple incidents and helps predict adversary behavior.

## Incident Documentation and Reporting

File Paths:
  - C:\Windows\System32\malware.exe
  - %APPDATA%\Temp\dropper.exe
```

## Automation and Tool Integration

### SOAR Integration for DFIR

I've implemented automated workflows that accelerate response:

```python
def automated_incident_response(alert_data):
    """
    Automated DFIR workflow trigger
    """
    # Evidence collection
    memory_dump = trigger_memory_capture(alert_data.hostname)
    disk_image = initiate_disk_imaging(alert_data.hostname)
    
    # Network isolation
    quarantine_host(alert_data.hostname)
    
    # Initial analysis
    ioc_results = scan_for_iocs(memory_dump, known_ioc_list)
    
    # Case creation
    case_id = create_forensic_case(alert_data, ioc_results)
    
    # Analyst notification
    notify_forensic_team(case_id, priority_level)
    
    return case_id
```
